wsProxy
=========

A simple proxy made for being the middle-man between a websocket client and dAmn, mainly wsc.

Note: It is not intended to be complicated and do things like log clients or statistics. All it does is creates a proxy between two hosts (and optionally outputs all packets sent between them.), and converts to/from websocket protocol.
